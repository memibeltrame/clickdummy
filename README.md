# clickdummy
Make click-through prototypes from screen designs.

## What is clickdummy?
clickdummy lets you create click-through prototypes from screens you design in a tool like Sketch or Photoshop. 
Well, ususally you would do this with a third party solution like inVision. But sometimes you can't. 

clickdummy is for you if:

- You need a self hosted or local prototype, maybe due to NDA constraints.
- You want to quickly integrate an image-based prototype into an HTML prototype.
- You need a free solution for your prototype.


## How it works
1. **Download zip**<br>Setting up could not be easier: 
  Download the zip file and unzip it. ðŸ¤© Done! ðŸ¤© 
1. **Copy Images**<br>Export your screens and move them into the pageimages folder.
1. **Define Pages**<br>Open the file pages.yaml and edit the list of pages.<br>The goto and animation parameters define what page will appear next and how.
1. **Open Prototype**<br>Open the file index.html in the Firefox browser

## Features
- Link from one screen to the next
- Define Hotspots for specific parts of the screen
- Define the dimensions of your prototype
- Use animations for page transitions
- Home-Screen App: install the prototype as a Home-Screen App
- Integrate the clickdummy prototype into an existing HTML prototype

**Planned Features**
- Linking to other webpages
- Top- and Bottom Bars
- Form fields
- Adding HTML Code
